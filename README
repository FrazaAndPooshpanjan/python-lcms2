python-lcms2

Simplified Python binding to LittleCMS2 library. 
This extension was created specially for SwatchBooker project. 
Nevertheless it can be used as a standalone package.

python-lcms2 emulates python-lcms interfaces for backward compatibility.
So you just need to replace in your code 'lcms' imports on 'lcms2'.
